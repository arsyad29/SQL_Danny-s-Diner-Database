<p align='center'><h1>Problem Statement</h1></p>
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
<br>1. sales</br>
<br>2. menu</br>
<br>3. members</br>

<p align='center'><h1>Case Study Questions</h1></p>
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

<br>1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</br>
<br>2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</br>
<br>3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</br>
<br>4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</br>
<br>5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?</br>
<br>6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</br>
<br>7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</br>
<br>8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</br>
<br>9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</br>
